#Location based reminder

Android prototype for a location based reminder. The aim was to be able to remind the user of certain tasks which are not specific to one point only but to many (one-point only is also possible though). For instance, you could set up a reminder that you need to buy some groceries at your preferred supermarket chain. The app would then request all shop locations from a server and remind you whenever you are, e.g., 200 meters near from the next shop.
